# Input Components

* The `TextInput` compenent is how we get text input from the user.
* You can call a callback setting the `onChangeText` prop. This callback will be called everytime the text changes.
* `maxLenght`: Do I really need to explain?
* `clearButtonMode`: only work in iOS.
* `secureTextEntry`: for passwords.
* Use `value` to set it's value.
