# DoneWithIt

This project is based in the DoneWithIt app, made in "The Ultimate React Native Series", by CodeWithMosh.

I'm using TypeScript instead of JavaScript because TS rocks

I'm also using Jest because I want to improve my testing skills.

## How to find yourself

* The code in each branch represents a section of the course.
* The main branch will be merged with each section, by the end of the section.

## Chore

* Create with `expot init` command, selecting the **blank (TypeScript)** option.

## Commands

* Run project: `npm start`.
